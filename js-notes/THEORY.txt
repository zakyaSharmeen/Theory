1-What are the different data types present in JavaScript?

Primitive types: String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Symbol, Undefined, and Null.
Non-primitive type: Object (including Arrays and Functions).

2-Explain Hoisting in JavaScript.
Hoisting means that JavaScript moves variable declarations to the top of their scope before running the code.Variables declared with var are hoisted without initialization, whereas let and const are hoisted but remain in the Temporal Dead Zone.

var is hoisted with an initial value of undefined.
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;

let and const are hoisted without an initial value, staying in the TDZ until declared.
console.log(y); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 10;

3-Why do we use the word “debugger” in JavaScript?
It pauses code execution, allowing inspection of variables and call stacks.

4-Difference between == and === operators.
comparision operators
== checks equality with only values.
=== checks strict equality with values and datatype

5-Difference between var and let keyword in JavaScript.
var has function scope, while let has block scope.
✅ var can be accessed inside the function n  outside the block
ex-function testVar() {
    if (true) {
        var x = 10;  
    }
    console.log(x); // ✅ Works! Output: 10
}
testVar();

❌ let and const cannot be accessed outside their block.
ex-function testLet() {
    if (true) {
        let y = 20;  
    }
    console.log(y); // ❌ Error! y is not defined outside the block
}
testLet();




6-Explain Implicit Type Coercion in JavaScript.
Implicit type coercion converts one data type to another automatically during operations.
Examples include string concatenation ('5' + 2 → '52') and arithmetic operations ('5' - 2 → 3).

7-Is JavaScript a statically typed or dynamically typed language?
JavaScript is dynamically typed, the type of variables is checked during run time

8-What is NaN property in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and 
represents an invalid number result.
It is of type Number and 
is not equal to itself (NaN !== NaN).

9-Explain passed by value and passed by reference.
Primitive types are passed by value, meaning a copy of the value is passed.
Objects are passed by reference, so modifications affect the original object.

10-What is an Immediately Invoked Function in JavaScript?
An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) executes immediately after definition.
It is written as (function() { ... })() to create a private scope.

functions----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are 7 most important types of functions in JavaScript with simple examples:

1️⃣ Function Declaration (Named function)
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}
greet(); // Output: Hello!

2️⃣ Function Expression (Anonymous function stored in a variable)
const greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
};
greet(); // Output: Hello!


3️⃣ Arrow Function (Shorter syntax)
const greet = () => console.log("Hello!");
greet(); // Output: Hello!

4️⃣ Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) (Runs immediately)
(function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
})(); // Output: Hello!

5️⃣ Higher-Order Function (Takes another function as a parameter)
function operate(a, b, func) {
    return func(a, b);
}
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
console.log(operate(5, 3, add)); // Output: 8

6️⃣ Callback Function (Function passed into another function)
function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
    callback();
}

greet("Alice", () => console.log("Welcome!"));

7️⃣ Recursive Function (Function calling itself)
function countdown(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return;
    console.log(n);
    countdown(n - 1);
}
countdown(3); // Output: 3, 2, 1

8️⃣ Generator Function (function* - Can pause and resume execution)

function* generateNumbers() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
}

const gen = generateNumbers();
console.log(gen.next().value); // Output: 1
console.log(gen.next().value); // Output: 2

9️⃣ Constructor Function (Used to create objects)
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
console.log(person1.name); // Output: Alice

🔟 Async Function (async/await - Handles asynchronous operations)
async function fetchData() {
    return "Data loaded!";
}

fetchData().then(console.log); // Output: Data loaded!
/-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11-What do you mean by strict mode in JavaScript and characteristics of JavaScript strict-mode?
the "use strict"keyword is used to define strict mode in  JavaScript
in strict mode , it doesnt allow to use js keywords as parameters or function name, or duplicate arguments

12-Explain Higher Order Functions in JavaScript.
Higher-order functions accept other functions as arguments or return them as results.
Examples include map(), filter(), and reduce().

13-Explain “this” keyword.
The this keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function.

14-What do you mean by Self-Invoking Functions?
Self-invoking functions are functions that execute immediately after they are defined.
They are written as (function() { ... })() and are often used for creating private scopes.

15-Explain call(), apply(), and bind() methods.
Method	When it Executes	Arguments Passed
call()	Executes Immediately	Passed One by One
apply()	Executes Immediately	Passed as an Array
bind()	Does NOT Execute Immediately	Passed One by One


16-What is currying in JavaScript?
Currying is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking one argument at a time.

normal function ex---   
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

add(2, 3); // 5

 \\\\\\\\    curried function
function add(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}

add(2)(3); // 5


17-What are some advantages of using External JavaScript?
it improves code reusability and 
maintainability by separating logic from HTML.
It  reduces loading time.

18-Explain Scope and Scope Chain in JavaScript.
Scope determines the visibility of variables and functions in a program.
The scope chain is the hierarchy of scopes used to resolve variable access.



20-Mention some advantages of JavaScript.
Runs on the client-side, reducing server load.
Supports event-driven and asynchronous programming.

21-What are object prototypes?
Object prototypes allow objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
They are part of the prototype chain used in JavaScript inheritance.

22-What are callbacks?
Functions passed as arguments to other functions.
Used for handling asynchronous tasks or events.

23-What are the types of errors in JavaScript?
SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError, RangeError, and EvalError.
These errors represent issues in code execution and structure.

24-What is memoization?
Memoization is a technique used to improve performance by storing the results
whenver the funct is called 1st time it value is stored in cache
and when the same input is given, it fetches the result from the cache instead of recomputing it.


25-What is recursion in a programming language?
A function calling itself to solve smaller sub-problems.
Requires a base case to terminate the recursion.

26-What is the use of a constructor function in JavaScript?
Used to create and initialize objects with properties and methods.
Acts as a template for creating multiple similar objects.
What is DOM?

27-DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree.
Allows JavaScript to interact with and modify HTML elements dynamically.

28-Which method is used to retrieve a character from a certain index?
charAt(index) retrieves the character at the specified index.
Alternatively, array-style indexing (e.g., string[index]) can be used.

29-What do you mean by BOM?
BOM (Browser Object Model) provides a way to interact with the browser window.
Includes objects like window, navigator, screen, and history.

30-What is the distinction between client-side and server-side JavaScript?
Client-side JavaScript runs in the browser for UI interaction and validation.
Server-side JavaScript runs on a server (e.g., Node.js) for backend tasks.

31-What are arrow functions?
Arrow functions are a concise syntax for defining functions using =>.
They do not have their own this context and are lexically scoped.

32-What do you mean by prototype design pattern?
A creational design pattern that creates new objects using existing objects as templates.
Useful for cloning objects efficiently.

33-Differences between declaring variables using var, let, and const.
var has function scope, let and const have block scope.
const creates immutable bindings, while let allows reassignment.

34-What is the rest parameter and spread operator?
The rest parameter (...args) gathers multiple arguments into an array.
The spread operator (...) expands elements of an array or object.

35-In JavaScript, how many different methods can you make on an object?
Methods can be added using object literals, prototypes, or class definitions.
There is no fixed limit to the number of methods on an object.

36-What is the use of promises in JavaScript?
Promises handle asynchronous operations by representing a value that may be available in the future.
They have states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected, allowing better error handling.

37-What are classes in JavaScript?

Classes are syntactic sugar over prototypes, providing a cleaner way to define objects and inheritance.
They include methods like constructor() and support inheritance through extends.



Explain WeakSet in JavaScript.

WeakSet is a collection of objects where the references are weak, meaning the objects can be garbage-collected if there are no other references to them.
It only allows unique object entries and does not have methods to iterate over its elements.
Why do we use callbacks?

Callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations by passing a function as an argument.
They allow executing code after a task completes, avoiding blocking the main thread.
Explain WeakMap in JavaScript.

WeakMap is a collection of key-value pairs where keys must be objects, and the references to the keys are weak.
WeakMap entries are not enumerable and are used for memory-efficient caching.
What is Object Destructuring?

Object destructuring is a syntax to unpack properties of an object into distinct variables.
It simplifies extracting multiple properties into separate variables.
Difference between prototypal and classical inheritance.

Prototypal inheritance is based on objects inheriting from other objects using prototypes.
Classical inheritance uses classes to define a blueprint for creating objects.
What is a Temporal Dead Zone?

Temporal Dead Zone is the period between the block scope creation and variable initialization where accessing let or const variables results in a ReferenceError.
It ensures variables are not accessible before their declaration in the code.
What do you mean by JavaScript Design Patterns?

JavaScript design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in JavaScript development.
Examples include Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns.
Is JavaScript a pass-by-reference or pass-by-value language?

JavaScript is pass-by-value for primitive data types.
It is pass-by-reference for objects, meaning changes to the object properties affect the original reference.
Difference between Async/Await and Generators usage to achieve the same functionality.

Async/await is syntactic sugar for Promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous.
Generators use yield to pause and resume functions, requiring a manual iterator or library to handle asynchronous workflows.
What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?

The primitive data types are: String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Symbol, Undefined, and Null.
These types are immutable and not objects.
What is the role of deferred scripts in JavaScript?

Deferred scripts are executed after the HTML document is fully parsed but before DOMContentLoaded event.
They improve page load performance by avoiding blocking HTML parsing.
What has to be done in order to put Lexical Scoping into practice?

Use nested functions to create closures that retain access to their parent scope variables.
Define variables in the appropriate block to limit their scope to that block.

define closures
A closure happens when a function remembers the variables from where it was created — even after that outer function has finished running.

function outerFunction() {
  let name = "Alice";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log("Hello, " + name); // 👈 has access to `name` from outer scope
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const greet = outerFunction(); // outerFunction runs and returns innerFunction
greet(); // 👉 Output: Hello, Alice
